## Introduction
The project is divided into three phases. In phase 1, you will implement the static version of PetPal as a presentable demo where users can navigate and see the features. However, it is not connected to a backend or frontend server. In phase 2, you will use Django and REST to implement the APIs, and, finally, in phase 3, you finalize the website using React JS. The eventual outcome of this project is a fully-functional website that meets the user stories listed in an upcoming section.
